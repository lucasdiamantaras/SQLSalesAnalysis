Creating a portfolio project with SQL to clean and analyze a medium to large dataset is a great idea. Here's a project suggestion that involves several key data cleaning and manipulation tasks:

# Project Suggestion: Analyzing E-Commerce Sales Data
## Project Overview:


### Objective: 
Clean and analyze a dataset from an e-commerce platform to derive insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

# The data:

## Online Retail Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Description: This is a dataset containing all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail. It includes attributes like invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country.

### Additional Variable Information
InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation. 
StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.
Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.	
InvoiceDate: Invice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.
UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides. 

# Key Tasks with SQL:



## Data Analysis:

Analyze sales trends over time.
Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
Product performance analysis and identifying best-sellers and underperformers.
Deliverables:

A SQL script containing all queries and transformations.
A report or dashboard visualizing key insights from the data.
A README file documenting process, findings, and any assumptions made during analysis.
