Creating a portfolio project with SQL to clean and analyze a medium to large dataset is a great idea. Here's a project suggestion that involves several key data cleaning and manipulation tasks:

# Project Suggestion: Analyzing E-Commerce Sales Data
## Project Overview:

### Objective: 
Clean and analyze a dataset from an e-commerce platform to derive insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

### Dataset: 
Use a publicly available e-commerce dataset. Websites like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or Google Dataset Search are good places to find such datasets. Look for a dataset that includes various attributes like order details, customer information, product categories, and timestamps.

# Key Tasks with SQL:

## Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values: Identify and impute or remove missing values in critical fields.
Standardize categories: Ensure that categorical data like product names, categories, or regions are standardized.
Correct data types: Make sure each column is of the appropriate data type (e.g., datetime, integer, text).
Data Transformation:

Normalize data: If the dataset is denormalized, create separate tables for customers, orders, and products.
Create calculated fields: Generate new columns for analysis, like order total, time to ship, etc.
Data Enrichment:

Join multiple tables: If working with normalized data, use JOIN operations to combine tables for analysis.
Aggregate data: Perform aggregations to summarize data, such as total sales per product category or average order value.

## Data Analysis:

Analyze sales trends over time.
Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
Product performance analysis and identifying best-sellers and underperformers.
Deliverables:

A SQL script containing all your queries and transformations.
A report or dashboard (optional, can use tools like Power BI, Tableau, or even Excel) visualizing key insights from the data.
A README file documenting your process, findings, and any assumptions made during analysis.

# Why This Project?

It demonstrates your skills in data cleaning, an essential aspect of data work.
E-commerce data is complex and relatable, showcasing your ability to handle real-world data.
The project covers a wide range of SQL operations, from basic to advanced, proving your proficiency in SQL.
Remember, the key to a good portfolio project is not just the technical skills but also your ability to document and explain your process and findings clearly. This project can showcase your end-to-end data handling capabilities, from cleaning raw data to deriving actionable insights.

# The data:
For an e-commerce data cleaning and analysis project, you'll want a dataset that's rich in attributes, including transactional data, customer information, product details, and potentially time-series data. Here are some datasets that are popular for such projects:

## Online Retail Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Description: This is a dataset containing all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail. It includes attributes like invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country.
